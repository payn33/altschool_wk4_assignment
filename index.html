    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a fullstack software engineer with a strong focus on
      building robust, scalable systems—from backend APIs to intuitive frontend
      interfaces. My journey into tech was driven by a deep curiosity for how
      systems work and a desire to create tools that solve meaningful problems.
      With experience across web technologies, I thrive at
      the intersection of code, data, and user experience.

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
    <p>
      Just trying to get a degree so imposter syndrome can finally get off my
      back—and I can start feeling like a real software engineer for once.
